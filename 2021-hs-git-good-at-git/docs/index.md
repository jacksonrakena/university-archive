Git is an incredibly powerful piece of software and a key part of the development toolchain for millions of developers and hundreds of thousands of companies, globally. Git probably powers most of the development cycle used to create the applications you use every day, and is a key part of the development of this very website!

Git is what we call a **version-control system**, which is a system we used to manage changes, edits, deletions, removals, and additions to our code bases. We can effectively use it to manage different **versions** of our code as we make our software better and better.

I'm **Jackson Rakena**, and I'm a computer programmer. I am/was a student of **Scots College, Wellington** in 2021. This website is part of my **AS91903** Digital Technologies internal, and you get to reap the benefits of my hard work.

So let's dive in!
