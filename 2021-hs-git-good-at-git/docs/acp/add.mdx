title: Adding files
---

The **Add-Commit-Push** cycle is how we send updates about our code to the Git server.  

When we change a file, we need to tell Git that the file has changed and that we want to add it to our list of changes (changelist).

Say we edited a file called `hello.txt`, let's tell Git that we changed it:
```
git add hello.txt
```
Git will not respond with anything if it was successful.
Now, if use the Git Status command, we can see the "status" of our added files:
```
git status
```
```
jacksonrakena@Jacksons-MacBook-Air my-repo % git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   hello.txt

```
Git is telling us that we have added `hello.txt` to our changelist, and is awaiting
us to "commit" our changes.

When we commit, we are signing a bundle of changes off, grouping them together into a neat little package.

A repository is just a chain of commits. We add files to a changelist, commit those files to a new commit, and
upload the new commit to the remote server, which will add it to the commit chain.

If you work with another person, your commits will be added to the chain, and so will theirs, when they make commits - and
as such, a collaborative project is just a long chain of commits by various people.

Here's a flowchart representing a commit chain:

So let's make a commit!
