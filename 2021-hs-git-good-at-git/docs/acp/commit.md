title: Creating a commit
---

Once we've added enough files to our changelist, we can solidify it and make a commit.
Commits need a "commit message", which is a short sentence describing our commit.

```
git commit -m "My first commit!
```
And Git will confirm it, giving us a commit ID and a quick overview of what changed:
```
[master (root-commit) 821a2a2] My first commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 hello.txt
```

If we type `git show`, Git will show us a overview of our commit chain:
```
git show
```
```
