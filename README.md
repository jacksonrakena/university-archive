This repository contains several older repositories from my time studying my undergraduate (Bachelor of Science) at Victoria University of Wellington; as well as some earlier work from high school (2015-2021)

### Projects overview

#### 2022-cgra151-game-project
CGRA151 (Introduction to Computer Graphics and Games) final project.

#### 2022-misc-ecs-grade-check
A fork of [isaacy2012/GetGradeECS](https://github.com/isaacy2012/GetGradeECS) that added the ability to notify via Discord ping instead of email. Doesn't work anymore. God speed, web scrapers.

A quick React app I made to easily make levels for our SWEN225 (Software Design) final game project.

#### 2021-hs-git-good-at-git
This project is from my last year of high school, for some NCEA Level 3 standard. It is a Git tutorial website targeted at high school students.
