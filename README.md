# Jackson's University Archive

This repository contains several older repositories from my time studying my undergraduate (Bachelor of Science) at Victoria University of Wellington (2022-2024); as well as some earlier work from high school (2015-2021)

### Works of note

#### 2019-hs-schoolbuddy (Year 11)
An UWP app made for my high school's Year 11 Group Project class. Students could add assignments and track their project.

#### 2020-hs-quicktable-ios and 2020-hs-quicktable-web (Year 12)
Native iOS and React (web) based versions of "Quicktable", a timetable app that connected to my high school's student management server to show the users timetable in a pretty format. It exploited a pretty open hole in on-premise [PCS](https://nelnetinc.com/businesses/pcschool/) that I'm not sure was ever patched.

#### 2022-misc-ecs-grade-check
A fork of [isaacy2012/GetGradeECS](https://github.com/isaacy2012/GetGradeECS) that added the ability to notify via Discord ping instead of email. Doesn't work anymore. God speed, web scrapers.

#### 2023-personal-wat-clone
A Rust-based clone of the "Web Assessment Tool". Students can answer code questions and the server will compile and run tests against it.

#### 2023-swen225-level-maker
A quick React app I made to easily make levels for our SWEN225 (Software Design) final game project.
